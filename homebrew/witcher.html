*"No, Essi," he said slowly.  "Don't look to me for the subject of a mooving ballad: that of the internally conflicted witcher.  I might like that to be the case, but it isn't.  My code and my training resolve every moral dilemma.  In that, I am well prepared."*

> ## Witcher Training

> As a rule, a witcher will spend their first five levels training
with their school.  However, this does not translate well into a
tabletop game.  A low-level witcher may be taken beyond the walls of
their school as part of their training.  DMs are encouraged to allow
ample downtime for low-level witchers to return to their school
between these "off-site" tests to continue their training and
education.  Alternatively, DMs might include a high-level NPC witcher
to act an in-the-field educator and mentor during these low-levels,
tasking the low-level player witcher to perform the "heavy lifting" of
the adventure.

\page

## Class Features
As a witcher, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per witcher level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constituion modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constituion modifier per archivist level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** Witcher tools
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Constitution
- **Skills:** Choose three(?) from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Arcana,
Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, Survival, Intimidation.

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- a longsword and a silvered longsword
- (a) leather armor or (b) hide armor
- witcher's tools
- an adventurer's pack

### The Trial of the Grasses

*[Draft notes:]
The first five items are almost purely roleplaying points.
Additional movespeed fits the lore, but should probably be dropped for balance; otherwise, it's in line with a Monk's (admittedly level 2) improved movespeed.
The next point, at least at low levels, is kind of in line with a Fighter's **Second Wind** (1d10 + level per short rest) as far as total total potential HP gain), but pretty quickly outscales it.
On the other hand, a lot of times a long-rest is paired with longer stretches downtime (that is, implicitly a second long rest), so it will only occasionally come into play.
The dim-light perk is half of what level 6 Aspect of the Beast -- Eagle Totem Warrior gets, so this is definitely strong for level 1.
I should probably break it into another Mutation Increase feature.
*


The path of a witcher begin in agony.  The Trial of the Grasses
induces mutations in the would-be witcher to improve both their longevity and their ability to survive the monsters they fight.  Beginning at the 1st level, a witcher gainst the following permanent changes:

* You now age at one-eighth the speed normal for your race.
* You are now sterile and cannot produce offspring.
* Your emotions are dulled.
* Your pupils are verticle slits, resembling that of a cat's.
* All domesticated cats are hostile towards you (though not necessarily aggressive).
* Your base speed increases by 10 feet.
* You regain all Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.
* Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

### Spellcasting: Signs

When you reach the 3rd level, you are trained in simple,
utility-focused magics called Signs.  See chapter 10 of the *Player's
Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting and both chapter 11
and below for details of the spells that Signs can duplicate.

***Signs.*** You learn the five witcher signs: *Aard*, *Axii*, *Igni*,
*Quen*, and *Yrden*.

Signs require only somatic components, but the effects produced by
Signs are generally much weaker or more restricted than the potent
magics available to other magic users.

Signs can reproduce effects of many other spells, detailed below.
However, a single sign cannot produce multiple effects at the same
time.  For instance, a witcher must dismiss 

***Spell Slots.***

The Witcher table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
Signs to produce effects of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the effect's level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For instance, if you have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast *Igni* to produce the effect of *Burning
Hands*.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intillegence is your spellcasting ability for your witcher spells, so
you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability.  In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a witcher spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

### Beastiary Training
*[Draft note:] Should I specify "Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence
(Investigation), and Intelligence (Arcana) checks"?*

You have advantage on any check made to identify a creature or its type.

### Witcher Senses

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track a creature.

### Witcher Weapons

*[Draft Note:] The designation here is less Men/Animal vs Monsters in
an attempt to keep only one weapon being actually used.  To fit the setting, the designation is more Natural / Material Plane vs Unnatural / Otherworldly*

*[Draft Note:] I'm having trouble deciding on how this should play out.  Fighters have a +2 to ranged attack and a +2 1h melee damage as options for fighting styles.  Maybe keeping it as a flat +2 would be fine and it doesn't need to scale with level, since it doesn't in Fighter.  Or this could be +Attack and the **Careful Preparation** could be +Damage*

Beginning at the 3rd level, you can imbue your weapons with power.  By
performing a special ritual with up to two weapons that deal slashing damage, you designate
one weapon for monsters and the other for mundane enemies.  When using
the designated weapon against a creature of the corresponding type,
you gain +2 to all damage rolls.  This bonus increases according to
the Witcher Weapon Damage Bonus column.


<div style='column-count:2'>
| Mundane<br>Witcher Weapon |
|:-----------------------|
| Beasts |
| Constructs |
| Dragons |
| Giants |
| Humanoids |
| Plants |

```
```

| Monsterous<br>Witcher Weapon |
|:--------------------------|
| Aberrations |
| Celestials |
| Elemental |
| Fey |
| Fiends |
| Monstrosities |
| Oozes |
| Undead |
</div>

### Witcher Medallion

Upon completion of your training as a witcher, you are awarded with a
*Witcher Medallion* fashioned into the symbol of your school.

Foremost, the medallion functions as proof of your training and
station as a witcher.  Additionally, when worn by a witcher, the
medallion vibrates in the presence of magic.

\page

### Deflect Misiles

*[Draft notes: Mostly a reskin of the Monk's **Deflect Missiles**,
except that you don't attack with the caught item]*

Starting at the 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or
catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack while you
are wielding one of your witcher weapons.  When you do so, the damage
you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier
+ your witcher level.

*[Draft note: Attack, sign, or none?  Maybe use as an improvement
later?]*

If you reduce the damage to 0, you may immediately cast a sign.


### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in
this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Careful Preparation

Beginning at the 4th level, a witcher may prepare for a specific foe.
During a short or long rest, a witcher may use witcher's tools to
create and apply special oils to their witcher weapons.  The oil
doubles the Witcher Weapon Damage Bonus to one creature type.  A different
type of oil may be applied to each witcher weapon, but only one oil
may effect a witcher weapon at a time.

### Emotionally Numb
*[Draft note:] Reskin of level 7 Monk **Stillness of Mind**]*

Through the combination of your progressing mutations and your
difficult life, you have gained full control of what little emotion
you yet feel.

Beginning at the 7th level, you may spend an action to end one effect
on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Improved Mutations
*[Draft note:] Reskin of level 10 Monk **Purity of Body**]*

At the 10th level, your mutations have progressed to grant you
unfailing health, making you immune to disease and poison.
