\paragraph*{Poison Expertise}
  At 1st level, your proficency bonus is doubled when using the poisoner's kit.
  Additionally, you are considered proficient in Intelligence (Medicine) for the purpose of extracting poison from a creature, if you were not proficient already.

\paragraph*{Personal Labratory}
At 1st level, when using downtime to create a poison in your personal labratory, you can make progress in 10gp increments instead of 5gp.
This bonus increases to 15gp increments at 2nd level, 20gp at 3rd level, 25gp at 4th level, and 30gp at 5th level.

\paragraph*{Poisonous Innovation}
  At 1st level, you may use your personal labratory to study and experiment with poisons.
  When crafting a poison, you may choose to change some of its six attributes.
  These attributes are: Delivery method, status effect imposed, damage dealt, duration, delay, and difficulty class.
  Options for each attribute are given below, with the standard attribute listed first and italicized.

  You may change a number of attributes up to your Master of Weeds level + 1.
  
  

\paragraph*{Cautious Cook}
At 2nd level, you can spend equal time and material components to create an antidote specific to any poison you can create.
This antidote negates any pending or lingering effects and grants immunity to that poison for one hour.
