Jerome's first mistake was to wake at all.
His head announced a dull and constant dissent with the previous day's proceedings,
 and Jerome could feel his pulse radiate through his swollen eye,
 a desperate pressure pummeling his sinuses with every heartbeat.
He timidly opened his eyes, unsurprised that only one obeyed.

Jerome's second mistake was to try to sit up.
Groaning and rolling like a drunk, he managed to push himself half upright.
His half-vision swam, and while his fall was still painful,
 he was thankful that the bed was softer than his usual pallet.
He tried again, more slowly this time, and managed to put his feet off the bed and look around.
