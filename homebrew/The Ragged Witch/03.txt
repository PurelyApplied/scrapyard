Waking up was a mistake.
From top to bottom, Jerome's body complained.
His crown lodged a dull but insistent complaint regarding previous day's proceedings.
His swollen eye radiated pain in a steady rhythm, desperate pressure pummeling his sinuses with every heartbeat.
His chest ached, piercing when he breathed too deeply.
His legs were sore, and the soles of his feet felt skinned.
He tried to open his eyes and was unsurprised that only one obeyed.

Jerome's second mistake was to try to sit up.
Groaning and rolling like a drunk, he managed to push himself half upright.
His half-vision swam, and while his fall was still painful,
 he was thankful that the bed was softer than his usual pallet.
He tried again, more slowly this time, and managed to put his feet off the bed and look around.

[[ The room

The door opened outward.

[[ Where's Gerald?
