  As he walked his guests out, Okosh Varazlo carefully but casually thumped his staff on one of the many
   indistinguishable tiles that made up the mosaic of his entryway floor.
  He had laid every piece of the eight-pointed star himself.
  Beyond all others, this is what made this tower his and his alone.
  At his beckon, the power he had placed there responded.
  The bar securing the door lifted upwards and the doors opened slowly inward.

  Late evening sunlight spilled across the mosaic.
  Each tile sparkled, so that it looked like a star-filled sky even as it looked like the setting sun itself.
  Tanulo, Okosh's apprentice, stumbled slightly as he followed his master, distracted by the dazzling display.
  Righting himself, he once again eyed their guests, another master and apprentice, with suspicion and jealousy.

  "I know I hardly have to say this," Okosh said, "but I will be rather upset if anything happens to this."
  His voice was simultaneously pleading and threatening as he made to hand a heavy tome to the other master.

  "It's not like you don't already have it memorized."
  The other master waved his hand dismissively and gestured his apprentice over.
  "Even if you didn't, you could reproduce the entire thing from first principles."
  He paused, as if debating whether to continue.
  "Not many could, you know."

  "I am fully aware of my own prowess, yes."
  Okosh did not care for flattery.
  "Just because I can doesn't mean I'd enjoy doing it."

  He frowned at the apprentice.
  Okosh produced an oilcloth to wrap the book, placing one and then the other in the apprentices awkwardly outstretch hands.
  He fretted slightly over the knotwork, taking longer than most would to secure the parcel.
  Tying too tightly could damage the tome, but too loosely would let the elements in on their travel.

  Okosh did not look up as he tied his knots.
  "I value this book more than your master values you."
  He spoke softly, but did not whisper.
  Whispering, he knew, would cause aspirate consonants to hiss and draw attention.
  He had made a brief, dallying study of phonaesthetics earlier in his life.
  It had been a passing fancy at the time, but it had proven itself valuable knowledge time and again.
  "Notably, I will care if something bad happens to this book."
  He finished the last knot and met the apprentice's now-wide eyes for the breadth of a heartbeat.
  "Think on that."

// "So you're training other apprentices now?"

// "What secrets do you think were in that book?"

// Quanta, fluxions, geometrics!  Cyphers, oh the cyphers.

// Look at this star.  One tile opens the door.  Another locks it.  One disables the wards, another reactivates them.
// About half of them are traps.  Some of those traps are overt and might kill you, defenseless as you are.
// Others are subtle.  You wouldn't notice them until it's much too late.

// How do you keep them all straight?

// He smiled.  "Preparation, patience, and practice."
