## The Witcher

“No, Essi,” he said slowly.  "Don't look to me for the subject of a
moving ballad: that of the internally conflicted witcher.  I might
like that to be the case, but it isn't.  My code and my training
resolve every moral dilemma.  In that, I am well prepared.” [1]

“I manage because I have to.
Because I've no other way out.
Because I've overcome the vanity and pride of being different,
 I've understood that they are a pitiful defense against being different.
Because I've understood that the sun shines differently when something changes.
The sun shines differently, but it will continue to shine, and jumping at it with a hoe isn't going to do anything.” [2]

“Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.”

“People," Geralt turned his head, "like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.”

### Specialized Killers for Hire

People of towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animaIs, as if
denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature
keen instincts, primaI physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands:
he tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes
ive and hunt.

Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
imes without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.


### Vagabond by Trade

Nol every member of the cily walch, lhe village mililia,
or the queen's army is a fighter. Mosl of these lroops are
relatively untrained soldiers wilh only lhe mosl basic
combat knowledge. Veleran soldiers, mililary officers,
lrained bodyguards, dedicated knighls, and similar
figures are fighlers.

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous work common among adventurers is
second nature for a fighter, not ali that different from
the life he ar she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards-few fighters in
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic
flame tongue sword, for example.

> ## Witcher Training

> As a rule, a witcher will spend their first five levels training
with their school.  However, this does not translate well into a
tabletop game.  A low-level witcher may be taken beyond the walls of
their school as part of their training.  DMs are encouraged to allow
ample downtime for low-level witchers to return to their school
between these "off-site" tests to continue their training and
education.  Alternatively, DMs might include a high-level NPC witcher
to act an in-the-field educator and mentor during these low-levels,
tasking the low-level player witcher to perform the "heavy lifting" of
the adventure.

## Class Features
As a witcher, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per witcher level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constituion modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constituion modifier per archivist level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** Witcher tools
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Constitution
- **Skills:** Choose three(?) from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Arcana,
Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, Survival, Intimidation.

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- a longsword and a silvered longsword
- (a) leather armor or (b) hide armor
- witcher's tools
- an adventurer's pack

<!--- Level 1 -->

### The Trial of the Grasses

> *[Draft notes:]*
> * The first five items are almost purely roleplaying points.
> * +movespeed fits the lore, but should probably be dropped for
> balance; otherwise, it's in line with a Monk's (admittedly level 2)
> improved movespeed.
> * The Hit Dice is, at least at low levels, kind of in line with a
> Fighter's **Second Wind** (1d10 + level per short rest) as far as
> total total potential HP gain), but pretty quickly outscales it.  On
> the other hand, a lot of times a long-rest is paired with longer
> stretches downtime (that is, implicitly a second long rest), so it
> might only occasionally come into play, depending on your campaign structure.
> I feel like something should be there for the Witchers Are Robust idea, but maybe the CON proficiency is enough of that already.

The path of a witcher begin in agony.  The Trial of the Grasses
induces mutations in the would-be witcher to improve both their longevity and their ability to survive the monsters they fight.  Beginning at the 1st level, a witcher gainst the following permanent changes:

* You now age at one-eighth the speed normal for your race.
* You are now sterile and cannot produce offspring.
* Your emotions are dulled.
* Your pupils are verticle slits, resembling that of a cat's.
* All domesticated cats are hostile towards you (though not necessarily aggressive).
* Your base speed increases by 10 feet.
* You regain all Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

> ### Multiclassing
> You might die.

### Witcher Weapons

*[Draft Note:] The designation here is less Men/Animal vs Monsters in
an attempt to keep only one weapon being actually used.  To fit the
setting, the designation is more Natural / Material Plane vs Unnatural
/ Otherworldly*

*[Draft Note:] Balance-speaking, this is essentially a stylized but
weaker **Fighting Style: Dueling**.  As the core, iconic feature of
witchers, perhaps this should scale to be a boost of Witcher Level/2+1
damage?  That seems excessive to me.*

Beginning at the 1st level, you learn to imbue your weapons with
power.  By performing a special ritual with up to two weapons that
deal slashing damage, you designate one weapon for monsters and the
other for mundane enemies.  When that weapon hits a creature of the
corresponding type, you gain +2 to the damage roll.

### Spellcasting: Signs

When you reach the 3rd level, you are trained in simple,
utility-focused magics called Signs.  See chapter 10 of the *Player's
Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting and both chapter 11
and below for details of the spells that Signs can mimic.

***Signs.*** You learn the five witcher signs: *Aard*, *Axii*, *Igni*,
*Quen*, and *Yrden*.

Signs require only somatic components, but the effects produced by
Signs are generally much weaker or more restricted than the potent
magics available to other practicioners.

Signs can reproduce effects of many other spells, detailed below.
However, a single sign cannot produce multiple effects at the same
time.  For instance, a witcher must dismiss

***Spell Slots.***
The Witcher table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
Signs to produce effects of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the effect's level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For instance, if you have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast *Igni* to produce the effect of *Burning
Hands*.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intillegence is your spellcasting ability for your witcher spells, so
you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability.  In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a witcher spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

<center>
    **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier
    <br><br>
    **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier
    <br><br>
</center>

<!--- Level 3 -->

### Witcher School

At 3rd level, you choose a witcher school: School of the Wolf, School
of the Cat, or School of the Griffon.  All schools are detailed at the
end of the class description.  The archetype you choose grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 7th, [...]

<!--- Level 4 -->
### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at [...], you can increase one
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1.  As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

<!--- Level 5 -->
### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

*[Probably drop the Fighter's biggest thing:]*

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in
this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

<!--- Level 6 -->

### Iris Control

*[Draft notes: The dim-light perk is half of what level 6 Aspect of
the Beast, so I figured that was the natural level for something like
this.  Part of me wants to add something about opening/closing your
irises to grant Darkvision with some down-side, but I'm currently
opting for a simpler-if-more-minor feature.]*

Upon reaching the 6th level, you have gained finer control over some
of your mutations.  Dim light no longer imposes disadvantage on your
Wisdom (Perception) checks.

### Witcher Senses

*[Draft notes: I thought that, with the improved vision being a
smaller feature, this would be a good addition to round out your New
Better Eyes.]*

Also at the 6th level, your improved eye control grants you advantage
on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track a creature.

<!--- Level 7 -->
### Emotionally Numb
*[Draft note:] Reskin of level 7 Monk **Stillness of Mind**]*

Through the combination of your progressing mutations and your
difficult life, you have gained full control of what little emotion
you yet feel.

Beginning at the 7th level, you may spend an action to end one effect
on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.


\page

## Witcher Schools

The different witcher schools focus on different avenues of combat.
The witcher school you choose reflects your approach.

### School of the Cat

#### Level 3 feature
#### Evasion (7)

### School of the Griffon

#### Level 3 feature
#### Level 7 feature

### School of the Wolf

#### Deflect Misiles

*[Draft notes: Mostly a reskin of the Monk's **Deflect Missiles**,
except that you don't attack with the caught item.  But as a
counterpoint, a Monk can only perform that according to their
remaining ki point.  Perhaps this should only be allowed Witcher Level
/ 2, perhaps?*

*[I also can't decide if I should only allow it to trigger when hit by
a ranged weapon attack.  I don't like the idea of absorbing a spell on
your sword.  It could perhaps work with casting Quen (thereby dropping
any existing Quen), but that seems too strong to me.  Maybe I could
allow it, but drop the class Hit Die, if I'm having a lot of
damage-avoidance features.]*

Starting at the 3rd level, you can attempt to deflect ranged weapon
attacks.

When hit by a ranged weapon attack while you are wielding one of your
witcher weapons, you spend your reaction to deflect the missile with
your weapon.  When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is
reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your witcher level.

*[Draft: Maybe Ranged Spell attacks?]*


#### Level 7 feature


### Beastiary Training
*[Draft note:] Should I specify "Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence
(Investigation), and Intelligence (Arcana) checks"?*

You have advantage on any check made to identify a creature or its type.


### Careful Preparation

Beginning at the 4th level, a witcher may prepare for a specific foe.
During a short or long rest, a witcher may use witcher's tools to
create and apply special oils to their witcher weapons.  The oil
doubles the Witcher Weapon Damage Bonus to one creature type.  A different
type of oil may be applied to each witcher weapon, but only one oil
may effect a witcher weapon at a time.

### Witcher Medallion

Upon completion of your training as a witcher, you are awarded with a
*Witcher Medallion* fashioned into the symbol of your school.

Foremost, the medallion functions as proof of your training and
station as a witcher.  Additionally, when worn by a witcher, the
medallion vibrates in the presence of magic.

\page

### Improved Mutations
*[Draft note:] Reskin of level 10 Monk **Purity of Body**]*

At the 10th level, your mutations have progressed to grant you
unfailing health, making you immune to disease and poison.

## Witcher Schools

### School of the Cat

- focus on stealth, crits
