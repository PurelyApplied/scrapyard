Waking up was a mistake.
Every part of Jerome's body hurt.
*No, not every part*, he thought.  *Take inventory...*

His crown lodged a dull but insistent complaint regarding previous day's proceedings.
His swollen eye radiated pain in a steady rhythm, desperate pressure pummeling his sinuses with every heartbeat.
His chest ached, a crescendo to piercing agony in his side when he breathed too deeply.
His legs were sore, and the soles of his feet felt skinned.
He tried to open his eyes and was unsurprised that only one obeyed.

Jerome's second mistake was to try to sit up.
Groaning and rolling like a drunk, he managed to push himself half upright.
His vision swam, and his arm buckled.
Falling face-first into the bed, part of his mind undaunted by the pain, or perhaps delirious from it, thought,
 *This bed is so soft!*
As he lay there, face down,
He tried again, more slowly this time, rolling onto his side and lurching into a sitting position.
Catching his breath, which was already labored, he took in his surroundings.

Jerome thought room would be kindly described as "cozy."
Small, perhaps twice again the size of the modest bed on which sat, but well appointed.
He had already noted the softness of the bed.
His feet brushed the top of a heavy rug made of some animal Jerome couldn't identify.
The window had actual glass, well-fitted and without draft.
The room was warm, the boards in the floor, walls, and ceiling even and without gaps.
A solid-looking, heavily varnished table occupied much of the remaining space.
No art hung on the walls, no decorations of any kind were present.
Austere and functional.
Perhaps "cozy" is a polite way of saying "drab."

The door opened inward.
A middle-aged woman entered carrying a wooden tray holding, astonishingly, a tea service.
Like the room, she was small, dressed functionally and without decoration.
Her hair was pulled back into a tail, and her skirts was loose enough to not interfere with her walking.
