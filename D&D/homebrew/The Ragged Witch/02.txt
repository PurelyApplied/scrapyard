Meryl sipped her tea.
Some mornings, like this one, she could believe the woods were peaceful.
The sun shone pleasantly on her small garden, where her tomatoes were ripening nicely.
A warm wind blew in through the window, picking up the scent of the lilac from the flowerbox.
Even her ornery, old goat seemed content to graze at the edge of her glade.
Meryl smiled and spent no effort beyond drinking her tea.

The tea was a Dwarven blend, deep and dark.
The merchant who sold it to her jokingly called it "practically coffee."
Even as it sat on the counter between sips, the smell nearly overwhelmed the lilacs.
The flavorful, bitter blackness could purportedly wake the dead for one last cup.
Meryl had never witnessed this herself,
 but it did do wonders masking the chalky mixture of herbs and alchemy she needed every morning.

As she finished her cup and her morning reprieve, she sensed someone coming down the path to her cottage.
She could faintly hear someone whistling tunelessly.
She smiled, always happily surprised when Jo'am came to visit.
She spent a moment straightening the table and chairs and set out an ewer and cups.
Then, she opened the door and stood on her stoop as Jo'am entered her clearing.

## If it hadn't been Meryl, but rather someone who didn't know the half-orc as she did,
##  Jo'am's entrance to the glade would have elicited a shriek of terror.
As Jo'am appeared at the edge of her glade, Meryl once again marveled at the gods' senses of humor.
Jo'am stood a head taller than any man she'd met, and he weighed half again as much as any brute.
With pale grey skin and a mangy beard, he looked every part the crazed orc ravager.
Yet incongruously, she heard him now singing a tavern song, misplacing most of the notes and many of the words,
 as he watched the trees as if they might do something to surprise him.
He wore an old sailor's hat, torn and tattered and several sizes too small for his head,
 and he carried with him a small pack covered in patches.
But even though his eyes were perpetually bloodshot, Meryl knew those eyes would wrinkle at the corners when he saw her.

"Ho there, Jo'am!" Meryl greeted warmly.

Jo'am startled slightly at her call, as if somehow not expecting to see her on his way to visit her cottage.
"Oh!  Ah.  Yeh."
He blinked, and a moment later, he grinned broadly.
"Ho there, gran!"
He stood stock still, looking at her.

Meryl waited patiently.
After a moment of silence, she asked him, "Come to pay me a visit me, have you?"
Another quiet moment passed between them.

Then, like a piece of clever artificery wound up, Jo'am sprang back to life.
"Yuh, gran!  Come for a visit."
He waved at her goat, walked slowly and carefully past her tomatoes, and through the door.
"Been down t'town."
