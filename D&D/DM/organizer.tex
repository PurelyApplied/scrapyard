  \section{Ogden and Goldie}\label{sec:ogdenAndGoldie}
  \headeritem{Also known as}{The Warrior and the Waif}

  Ogden and Goldie are an adventuring duo, non-romantic couple that frequently crosses paths with
   The Group.
  Their path often intersects with The Group's between adventures, as they have gone on their own
  adventures in the meantime.
  Ogden and Goldie will perhaps pick up the adventures that The Group turns down, progressing
  critical plot points in tandem.

  They are almost comical in their night-and-day contrast to each other, sharing only that they are
   both absurdly gorgeous, both favor studded leather armor in combat and loose clothing in social
   situations, and both wear pendants of the Raven Queen.

  \subsection{Ogden}\label{subsec:ogden}
  Big, burly, brash, and black hair.
  Wields a glaive and carries two longswords "just in case."
  \dmonly{Pack of the Blade: the glaive.}
  \dmonly{Use Gladiator stat block plus minor spellcasting, set CHA to 18, CR 5+}

  \subsection{Goldie}\label{subsec:goldie}
  Small, thing, quiet, and platinum blonde.
  Sorceress, wields a quarterstaff as necessary.
  \dmonly{Pack of the Tome: grants Fire Bolt, Dancing Lights, Ray of Frost}
  \dmonly{Use Mage stat block, swap in some Warlock spells,
    consider Studded Leather Armor, set Cha 18, CR 6+}
  \subsection{Plot points}\label{subsec:plotPoints}
  \dmonly{
    Ogden and Goldie are both in truth warlocks of the Hexblade.
    After the Act I arc, The Group will be invited to a high society gala to celebrate
     their successes.
    Goldie will distract the court magus with conversation and a low-cut dress.
    Ogden will speak with one or more members of The Group.
    After a lull, Ogden will sigh and excuse himself with the following.

    ``[sigh] Well, I should probably get to it then.
      I've enjoyed our conversations over the past weeks.
      No, I mean it.
      I'll remember you fondly, no matter what.
      [pause]
      I hope you do the same.''

    He walks towards Goldie, who looks up.
    He nods at her.
    Simultaneously, she summons her warpick and he his glaive.
    She caves in the skull of the magus while Ogden sheers the head off of Plot Target.
    Both flee immediately, mist
