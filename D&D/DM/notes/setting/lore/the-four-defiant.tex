\section{Stomah and the Four Defiant -- The Origin of the Empire}

\textit{This is a story told throughout the Empire, by bards in barrooms, by youths around
  campfires, and by parents to their restless children (albeit they might be less explicit).
While all of them -- bards, youths, and parents -- are notorious liars, the story of Stomah's
  march across the modern-day Empire is generally accepted as truth, within the bounds of
  exaggeration accepted as good story-telling.
While not going so far as to have their own temples, Stomah and The Four Defiant themselves are now
  revered almost as gods for their foundational importance to the Empire.}

\medskip

In the days before the Empire, we warred with the beastman constantly.
Herders worried less about wolves taking sheep than they did about gnolls taking their lives.
These dark, harsh times made dark, harsh people.
People like Stomah.

Stomah rose from the glowing embers of her ruined village with nothing but a sword and a promise:
  the beastmen would pay to the last.
She traveled from town to town, taking the long and dangerous paths.
In her wake, the beast-tribes burned.
Gnolls lay be the roadside, gnarled and twisted.
Kobold caves filled with fallen, each one cracked and broken.
Lizardmen lay lacerated, bullywug bodies bloated.

In time, Stomah's name would be feared and revered.
In every city she would visit, every town, every village, every hamlet,
  men and women would join her.
Men and women would make their own promises and take up their own swords.
She would lead them onward, always along the long and dangerous paths.

Yet in those early days, before her host became her army, before her ruined home became the seat of
  an Empire and she our First Empress, before any of that, she was joined by a band
  -- The Four Defiant.
The Defiant had themselves crushed many beastmen under their collective heel,
  not for revenge, but for profit.
The band of adventurers kept the area safe, which keep them fed.
They were known as talented mercenaries, but altruists, they were not.

No one knows what Stomah said to bring them to her cause driving out the beastmen.
Perhaps she pleaded, impassioned to moved their hearts, sparking a hope they had themselves
  thought smothered.
But join her, they did.

The Four Defiant, each member a force unto themselves, were together far greater than the sum
  of their individual parts.
Now with Stomah, they were an unbreakable alloy.

Celadir, the only one of the four whose name still lives on.
The half-Elf would later be named The Regent, though he wouldn't know it at the time
  and would come to renounce it in the end.
Celadir became advisor and confidant and, some rumored, lover to Stomah.
Throughout history both before and since, he was unmatched as a tactician.
It is said that for every life Stomah ended, Celadir's wisdom saved ten.

The Raven, an Elf old even among Elves with skin of charcoal and ash.
Her tattered robes covered tattooed whorls, which whirled and roiled when she cast her spells.
Celadir's understanding of combat let the Defiant predict every attack,
  but it was the Raven's magic that let them survive it.

The Wrecker, a half-Orc tinkerer, his leather gloves, leather apron, and rough leathery face all
  perpetually strained in soot and grease.
The Wrecker could break a siege by himself, given enough time, iron, and wire.
His heavy work hammer and strong arm were deadly in a melee, but deadlier still in his workshop.

Lastly, yes always last, always deferent, always quiet was Poise.
Perhaps the young human had words for Stomah and the Defiant, but she never spoke to any other.
Her pale hair floated in wisps, and her downcast eyes and small frame belied her nature.
She was the patient, ceaseless roll of the sea.
She was the undertow that dragged the unwitting beyond the safety of shore to drown them there.

###

And so the group traveled the roads that today mark the outskirts of our Empire.
Their name, fame, and fortune grew, and with that so too did their number.

Stomah and her warriors pressed onward.
Before their blades, the beastmen fell.
Before their wrath, the beastmen fled.

Stomah, the Defiant, and their host drove the beastmen east,
  towards the great and wild Rahlu River.
On they pressed them, to the ancient, wide bridge called the Bastion.

That night, they paused in their attack, Stomah and her forces on the western side of the Bastion,
  the dwindling number of beastmen on the east.



####
The host driven east.
Stomah pursued.
Celadir voiced concern about exposing themselves.
Stomah orders her four most trusted warriors, advisors, friends to stay.
The rest of the host pushes north.

The Yuan-ti, the serpent-men, are as devious as they are vile.
Stomah is assassinated.
The Yuan-ti descend upon the western banks of the river.
They are not prepared.

The Raven, The Wrecker, The Regent, The Wrath, score a line in the earth.
Those abominations that dared to cross it were mete a brutal reward.

The Yuan-ti horde flowed for ages, but the fervent fury of the four was unending.
