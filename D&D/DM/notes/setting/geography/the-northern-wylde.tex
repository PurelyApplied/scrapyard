\section{The Northern Wylde}
\headeritem{Structure}{Desolation}

The farther north one travels, the more dense the forest becomes.
A small village, Dileah, is nestled in these woods, built up as a logging camp expanded outward.
This village and the roads from it mark the edge of The Empire's will and interest in the norther
 reaches.

A day's walk north of Dileah, scraps of white cloth dangle from tree limbs, another tied every
 dozen strides.
This ragged line traces roughly the line that which a cartographer would draw on a map.
Locals call this "the edge."
This marks the edge of The Empire's promise of protection.

Continue several hours farther, through thick bramble and undergrowth, and you would find
 bright red ribbons tied in a similar fashion.
These drift and snap in an unfelt wind, despite the heavy stillness of the woods.
They mark the edge of safety.

According to the folklore in Dileah and the surrounding villages, the "rag line" marks the territory
 of The Ragged Witch.
Most who cross the rag line are never seen again.
Of those that are, many are found
Those that do are found bloodied, gagged, and bound under one of the white strips
