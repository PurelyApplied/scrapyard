\section{The Empire}
\headeritem{Structure}{Feudal Monarchy}

The yuan-ti established an empire but were driven out, slaughtered wholesale.
Some few escaped east, into the Tribal Wastes.

\subsection{Culture}
\subsubsection{Race Relations}
The Empire was founded in driving out the violent beast races.
While non- and half-humans are recognized all the rights of citizens, an attitude of human
 superiority pervades.

Elves are viewed as exotic novelties, despite many having been born and raised within Empire cities.
Half-orcs struggle to find work beyond menial labor.
Dragonborn, Aasimar and Tiefling tend to wear robes to keep their face and features hidden.

In cities, non-humans will have their own neighborhoods.
These aren't the slums common to third-class citizens, but intermixing is rare.
