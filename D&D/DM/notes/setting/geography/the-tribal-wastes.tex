\section{The Tribal Wastes}
\headeritem{Structure}{Fractured Clans}

Over the centuries, the beast tribes discovered in The Empire have been,
 if not slaughtered outright, driven east.
A partial misnomer, the Wastes are not a barren desert, but a lush grassland.
However, pockets of Gnolls, Goblins, Trolls, Orcs, Kobolds, Bullywugs, Lizardmen, and
 remnants of the once powerful Yuan-ti make travel into the Wastes lethal for almost
 all who enter it.

Aarakocra and Kenku tribes are also found in the Wastes.
These are often the only safe haven from an onslaught of violence that would befall those
 that must travel the Wastes.
