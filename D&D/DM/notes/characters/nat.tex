Nat's is a merchant's apprentice suddenly left in charge of the wagon after he and his master
  driven into the Ragged Witch's territory fleeing a pair of dire wolves.
His master was left to Meryl's ministrations, and Nat was sent away under the witch's geas to
  offer transport eastward anyone bearing her marker.
He wears a lightning-blue askot.

Nat's father was a regionally-reputed bard.
While not infused with the same magical qualities, Nat has a fair baritone in his own right.

Nat can create decent forgeries for travel documents.
