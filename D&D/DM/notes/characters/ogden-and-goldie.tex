\section{Ogden and Goldie}\label{sec:ogdenAndGoldie}
\headeritem{Also known as}{The Warrior and the Waif}

Ogden and Goldie are an adventuring duo, non-romantic couple that frequently crosses paths with
The Group.
Their path often intersects with The Group's between adventures, as they have gone on their own
adventures in the meantime.
Ogden and Goldie will perhaps pick up the adventures that The Group turns down, progressing
critical plot points in tandem.

They are almost comical in their night-and-day contrast to each other, sharing only that they are
both absurdly gorgeous, both favor studded leather armor in combat and loose clothing in social
situations, and both wear pendants of the Raven Queen.

\dmonly{
Ogden and Goldie are both in truth warlocks of the Hexblade.
After the Act I arc, The Group will be invited to a high society gala to celebrate
their successes.
Goldie will distract the court magus with conversation and a low-cut dress.
Ogden will speak with one or more members of The Group.
After a lull, Ogden will sigh and excuse himself with the following.

``[sigh] Well, I should probably get to it then.
I've enjoyed our conversations over the past weeks.
No, I mean it.
I'll remember you fondly, no matter what.
[pause]
I hope you do the same.''

He walks towards Goldie, who looks up.
He nods at her.
Simultaneously, she summons her warpick and he his glaive.
She caves in the skull of the magus while Ogden sheers the head off of Plot Target.
Both flee immediately, mist
