\section{Preface: Buddyhawks has an accident}
\subsection{A view from a hilltop}
  \begin{aloud}
  A mid-spring sunset is shining down on your back.
  You and the dwarf Gluri Frosthand, leader of the Crazy Kuo-toa are crouched in tall grass atop
    a hill, not deep into the Eastern Wastes.
  You have been tracking a Gnoll warband for the better part of a week, making sure you will be
    able to warn the Bastion if it looks like they plan to attack.

  The dwarf holds a spyglass in his left hand while nervously tugging on his medium-length goatee
    with the three remaining fingers of his ruined right hand.
  You are watching the immediate area while he spys on whatever it is he sees.
  Gluri emits a sound halfway between a grunt and a growl.
  \end{aloud}

Converse.
Hand Spacky the looking glass.  ``What do you make of this shit?''

Roll Perception?  Maybe get redirected, maybe it takes a second.

You see a detachment moving away from the warband.
A woman stands alone in tall grass.
DC 12 to her running her hands low through the grass
15 to notice the grass bend in a way that suggests there are things moving through it.
Oppose a +4 Stealth to see a glint of scales.

The detachment stops short.
After a brief back and forth, the woman follows them back to their camp.

Converse.
``It's not fucking good, I'd bet that.

A gnoll scout sneaks up, vs Perception and Stealth (+1).
